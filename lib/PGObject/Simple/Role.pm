=head1 NAME

PGObject::Simple::Role - Moo/Moose mappers for minimalist PGObject framework

=head1 VERSION

Version 2.0.2

=cut

our $VERSION = 2.000002;

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Take the following (Moose) class:

    package MyAPP::Foo;
    use PGObject::Util::DBMethod;
    use Moose;
    with 'PGObject::Simple::Role';

    has id  => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Int', required => 0);
    has foo => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', required => 0);
    has bar => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Str', required => 0);
    has baz => (is => 'ro', isa => 'Int', required => 0);

    sub _get_dbh {
        return DBI->connect('dbi:Pg:dbname=foobar');
    }
    #  PGObject::Util::DBMethod exports this
    dbmethod int => (funcname => 'foo_to_int');

And a stored procedure:  

    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION foo_to_int
    (in_id int, in_foo text, in_bar text, in_baz int)
    RETURNS INT LANGUAGE SQL AS
    $$
    select char_length($2) + char_length($3) + $1 * $4;
    $$;

Then the following Perl code would work to invoke it:

    my $foobar = MyApp->foo(id => 3, foo => 'foo', bar => 'baz', baz => 33);
    $foobar->call_dbmethod(funcname => 'foo_to_int');

The following will also work since you have the dbmethod call above:

    my $int = $foobar->int;

The full interface of call_dbmethod and call_procedure from PGObject::Simple are
supported, and call_dbmethod is effectively wrapped by dbmethod(), allowing a
declarative mapping.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES AND LAZY GETTERS


=cut


has _dbh => (  # use dbh() to get and set_dbh() to set
       is => 'lazy', 
       isa => sub { 
                    croak "Expected a database handle.  Got $_[0] instead"
                       unless eval {$_[0]->isa('DBI::db')};
       },
);

has _DBH => ( # backwards compatible for 1.x. 
	is => 'lazy',
       isa => sub { 
                    warn 'deprecated _DBH used.  rename to _dbh when you can';
                    croak "Expected a database handle.  Got $_[0] instead"
                       unless eval {$_[0]->isa('DBI::db')};
       },
);

sub _build__dbh {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->{_DBH} if $self->{_DBH};
    return $self->_get_dbh;
}

sub _build__DBH {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->{_dbh} if $self->{_dbh};
    return $self->_dbh;
}

sub _get_dbh {
    croak 'Invoked _get_dbh from role improperly.  Subclasses MUST set this method';
}

has _registry => (is => 'lazy');

sub _build__registry {
    my ($self) = @_;
    return $self->_get_registry() if $self->can('_get_registry');
    _get_registry();
}

=head2 _get_registry

This is a method the consuming classes can override in order to set the
registry of the calls for type mapping purposes.

=cut

sub _get_registry{
    return undef;
}

has _funcschema => (is => 'lazy');

=head2 _get_schema

Returns the default schema associated with the object.

=cut

sub _build__funcschema {
    return $_[0]->_get_schema;
}

sub _get_schema {
    return undef;
}

has _funcprefix => (is => 'lazy');

=head2 _get_prefix

Returns string, default is an empty string, used to set a prefix for mapping
stored prcedures to an object class.

=cut

sub _build__funcprefix {
    my ($self)  = @_;
    return $self->_get_prefix;
}

sub _get_prefix {
    return '';
}

=head1 READ ONLY ACCESSORS (PUBLIC)

=head2 dbh

Wraps the PGObject::Simple method

=cut

sub dbh {
    my ($self) = @_;
    if (ref $self){
	return $self->_dbh;
    }
    return "$self"->_get_dbh;
}

=head2 funcschema

Returns the schema bound to the object

=cut

sub funcschema {
    my ($self)  = @_;
    return $self->_funcschema if ref $self;
    return "$self"->_get_schema();
}

=head2 funcprefix

Prefix for functions

=cut

sub funcprefix {
    my ($self) = @_;
    
    return $self->_funcprefix if ref $self;
    return "$self"->_get_prefix();
}

=head1 REMOVED METHODS

These methods were once part of this package but have been removed due to
the philosophy of not adding framework dependencies when an application 
dependency can work just as well. 

=head2 dbmethod

Included in versions 0.50 - 0.71.

Instead of using this directly, use:

   use PGObject::Util::DBMethod;

instead.  Ideally this should be done in your actual class since that will 
allow you to dispense with the extra parentheses.  However, if you need a
backwards-compatible and central solution, since PGObject::Simple::Role 
generally assumes sub-roles will be created for managing db connections etc. 
you can put the use statement there and it will have the same impact as it did
here when it was removed with the benefit of better testing.
